------------------- Comparison to omprimes2 -------------------

========== omprimes2 100000000 32 ==========
real 16.63 <- 32X longer than omprimes3 link machine
user 53.88 <- twice as long as omprimes3
sys 0.46
real 16.63 <- much larger than link machine
user 53.75 <- 2.5 times longer than omprimes3
sys 0.41
real 16.61
user 54.03 <- 1.5 times longer than omprimes3
sys 0.40

It seems like omprimes3 runs a LOT quicker than omprimes2, in both user and real time.

Also, it seems as though the link machines have a much larger real time than the V20 machine. Not sure why this is.

========== omprimes4 100000000 32 LINK ==========
real 8.98 <- twice as fast as omprimes3
user 46.63 <- slightly faster than omprimes3
sys 0.40
real 8.45
user 44.31 <- also slightly faster than omprimes3
sys 0.40
real 9.56
user 51.00 <- about the same speed as omprimes3
sys 0.40

Looks like there is a noticeable difference, albeit not by an incredibly large margin.

Still, an improvement is an improvement!
